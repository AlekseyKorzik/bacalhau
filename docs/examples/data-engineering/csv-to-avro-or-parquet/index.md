## Introduction

Converting from csv to parquet or avro reduces the size of file and allows for faster read and write speeds. With Bacalhau, you can convert your csv files stored on ipfs or on the web without the need to download files and install dependencies locally.

In this example tutorial we will convert a csv file from a url to parquet format and save the converted parquet file to IPFS


## Prerequisites

To get started, you need to install the Bacalhau client, see more information [here](https://docs.bacalhau.org/getting-started/installation)

## Running CSV to Arvo or Parquet Locallyâ€‹


Installing dependencies



```bash
%%bash
git clone https://github.com/js-ts/csv_to_avro_or_parquet/
pip3 install -r csv_to_avro_or_parquet/requirements.txt
```


```python
%%cd csv_to_avro_or_parquet
```

Downloading the test dataset



```python
!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/js-ts/csv_to_avro_or_parquet/master/movies.csv  
```

Running the conversion script arguments


```bash
%%bash
python3 src/converter.py ./movies.csv  ./movies.parquet parquet

# python converter.py path_to_csv path_to_result_file extension
```

Viewing the parquet file


```python
import pandas as pd
pd.read_parquet('./movies.parquet').head()
```

## Containerize your Script

:::info
You can skip this section entirely and directly go to running on bacalhau
:::

To build your own docker container, create a `Dockerfile`, which contains instructions to build your image.

```
FROM python:3.8

RUN apt update && apt install git

RUN git clone https://github.com/js-ts/Sparkov_Data_Generation/

WORKDIR /Sparkov_Data_Generation/

RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Building your Docker Container

We will run `docker build` command to build the container;

```
docker build -t <hub-user>/<repo-name>:<tag> .
```

Before running the command replace;

- **hub-user** with your docker hub username, If you donâ€™t have a docker hub account [follow these instructions to create docker account](https://docs.docker.com/docker-id/), and use the username of the account you created

- **repo-name** with the name of the container, you can name it anything you want

- **tag** this is not required but you can use the latest tag


Now you can push this repository to the registry designated by its name or tag.


```
 docker push <hub-user>/<repo-name>:<tag>
```

After the repo image has been pushed to docker hub, we can now use the container for running on Bacalhau.


## Running a Bacalhau Job

Using the `bacalhau docker run` command you can either mount the script from a IPFS or from an URL.

### Mounting the CSV File from IPFS


```bash
%%bash --out job_id
bacalhau docker run \
-i QmTAQMGiSv9xocaB4PUCT5nSBHrf9HZrYj21BAZ5nMTY2W  \
--wait \
--id-only \
 jsacex/csv-to-arrow-or-parquet \
-- python3 src/converter.py ../inputs/transactions.csv  ../outputs/transactions.parquet parquet
```

### Mounting the CSV File from an URL

```
bacalhau docker run \
-u https://raw.githubusercontent.com/js-ts/csv_to_avro_or_parquet/master/movies.csv   jsacex/csv-to-arrow-or-parquet \
-- python3 src/converter.py ../inputs/movies.csv  ../outputs/movies.parquet parquet
```

When a job is sumbitted, Bacalhau prints out the related `job_id`. We store that in an environment variable so that we can reuse it later on.


```python
%env JOB_ID={job_id}
```

## Checking the State of your Jobs

- **Job status**: You can check the status of the job using `bacalhau list`.


```bash
%%bash
bacalhau list --id-filter ${JOB_ID}
```

    [92;100m CREATED  [0m[92;100m ID       [0m[92;100m JOB                     [0m[92;100m STATE     [0m[92;100m VERIFIED [0m[92;100m PUBLISHED               [0m
    [97;40m 10:19:19 [0m[97;40m 94774248 [0m[97;40m Docker jsacex/csv-to... [0m[97;40m Completed [0m[97;40m          [0m[97;40m /ipfs/QmdHJaMmQHs9fE... [0m



When it says `Published` or `Completed`, that means the job is done, and we can get the results.

- **Job information**: You can find out more information about your job by using `bacalhau describe`.


```bash
%%bash
bacalhau describe ${JOB_ID}
```

- **Job download**: You can download your job results directly by using `bacalhau get`. Alternatively, you can choose to create a directory to store your results. In the command below, we created a directory and downloaded our job output to be stored in that directory.


```bash
%%bash
rm -rf results && mkdir -p results
bacalhau get $JOB_ID --output-dir results
```

    Fetching results of job '94774248-1d07-4121-aac8-451aca4a636e'...
    Results for job '94774248-1d07-4121-aac8-451aca4a636e' have been written to...

    2022/11/12 10:20:09 failed to sufficiently increase receive buffer size (was: 208 kiB, wanted: 2048 kiB, got: 416 kiB). See https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go/wiki/UDP-Receive-Buffer-Size for details.


## Viewing your Job Output

Each job creates 3 subfolders: the **combined_results**, **per_shard files**, and the **raw** directory. To view the file, run the following command:


```bash
%%bash
ls results/combined_results/stdout
```

Alternatively, you can do this.


```python
import pandas as pd
import os
pd.read_parquet('results/combined_results/stdout/transactions.parquet')
```
