# Stable Diffusion on a GPU

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bacalhau-project/examples/blob/main/model-inference/stable-diffusion-gpu/index.ipynb)
[![Open In Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bacalhau-project/examples/HEAD?labpath=model-inference/stable-diffusion-gpu/index.ipynb)

This example tutorial demonstrates how to use stable diffusion on a GPU and run it on the [Bacalhau](https://www.bacalhau.org/) network.[Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) is a state of the art text-to-image model that generates images from text and was developed as an open source alternative to [DALL·E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/). It is based on a [Diffusion Probabilistic Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09672) and uses a [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) to generate images from text. Before we begin, here is a quick test

## Prerequisite

To get started, you need to install the Bacalhau client, see more information [here](https://docs.bacalhau.org/getting-started/installation)

### Quick Test

The following command generates is an example of an image generated by this model.

```bash
bacalhau docker run --gpu 1 ghcr.io/bacalhau-project/examples/stable-diffusion-gpu:0.0.1 -- python main.py --o ./outputs --p "cod swimming through data"
```

## Sample Model - Development

This stable diffusion example is based on the Keras/Tensorflow implementation of the model available [here](https://github.com/fchollet/stable-diffusion-tensorflow). You might also be interested in the Pytorch oriented [diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers).

In order to run this example you need:

* A Debian-flavoured Linux (although you [might be able](https://github.com/fchollet/stable-diffusion-tensorflow/blob/master/requirements_m1.txt) to get it working on M1 macs)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* A GPU -- this was developed against a Tesla T4

### Installing dependencies

:::info
When you run this code for the first time, it will download the pretrained weights, which may add a short delay.
:::


```bash
%%bash
pip install git+https://github.com/fchollet/stable-diffusion-tensorflow --upgrade --quiet
pip install tensorflow tensorflow_addons ftfy --upgrade --quiet
pip install tqdm
apt install --allow-change-held-packages libcudnn8=8.1.0.77-1+cuda11.2
```

### Testing the Code

We will try the code in the [Stable Diffusion in TensorFlow/Keras README](https://github.com/fchollet/stable-diffusion-tensorflow) to check if the code is working as expected. Our output for this code will be a _DSLR photograph of an astronaut riding a horse_.

:::tip
When you run this code for the first time, it will download the pretrained weights, which may add a short delay.
:::


```python
from stable_diffusion_tf.stable_diffusion import Text2Image
from PIL import Image

generator = Text2Image( 
    img_height=512,
    img_width=512,
    jit_compile=False,  # You can try True as well (different performance profile)
)
img = generator.generate(
    "DSLR photograph of an astronaut riding a horse",
    num_steps=50,
    unconditional_guidance_scale=7.5,
    temperature=1,
    batch_size=1,
)
pil_img = Image.fromarray(img[0])
display(pil_img)
```

:::tip
If you're interested, check the GPU RAM usage now you've run the code. You'll see that it's sucked up many GBs and depending on what GPU you're running, it may OOM if you run this again.

You can try and reduce RAM usage by playing with batch sizes (although it is only set to 1 above!) or more carefully controlling the tensorflow session.
:::

Now, we will clear the GPU memory with **numba**. This won't be required when running in a single-shot manner.


```bash
%%bash
pip install numba
```


```python
# clearing the GPU memory 
from numba import cuda 
device = cuda.get_current_device()
device.reset()
```

### Write the Script

You need a script to execute when we submit our job. The code below is functionally the same as above, but it also includes argument parsing to be able to customize the generator. This code is a slightly modified version of the [text2image.py script in the original repository](https://github.com/fchollet/stable-diffusion-tensorflow/blob/master/text2image.py).


```python
%%writefile main.py
import argparse
from stable_diffusion_tf.stable_diffusion import Text2Image
from PIL import Image
import os
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Stable Diffusion")
parser.add_argument("--h",dest="height", type=int,help="height of the image",default=512)
parser.add_argument("--w",dest="width", type=int,help="width of the image",default=512)
parser.add_argument("--p",dest="prompt", type=str,help="Description of the image you want to generate",default="cat")
parser.add_argument("--n",dest="numSteps", type=int,help="Number of Steps",default=50)
parser.add_argument("--u",dest="unconditionalGuidanceScale", type=float,help="Number of Steps",default=7.5)
parser.add_argument("--t",dest="temperature", type=int,help="Number of Steps",default=1)
parser.add_argument("--b",dest="batchSize", type=int,help="Number of Images",default=1)
parser.add_argument("--o",dest="output", type=str,help="Output Folder where to store the Image",default="./")

args=parser.parse_args()
height=args.height
width=args.width
prompt=args.prompt
numSteps=args.numSteps
unconditionalGuidanceScale=args.unconditionalGuidanceScale
temperature=args.temperature
batchSize=args.batchSize
output=args.output

generator = Text2Image(
    img_height=height,
    img_width=width,
    jit_compile=False,  # You can try True as well (different performance profile)
)

img = generator.generate(
    prompt,
    num_steps=numSteps,
    unconditional_guidance_scale=unconditionalGuidanceScale,
    temperature=temperature,
    batch_size=batchSize,
)
for i in range(0,batchSize):
  pil_img = Image.fromarray(img[i])
  image = pil_img.save(f"{output}/image{i}.png")

```

You should test that your script works! Let's run it again.


```bash
%%bash
python main.py
```

### Viewing the Output Image


```python
import IPython.display as display
display.Image("image0.png")
```

:::info
For a full list of arguments that you can pass to the script, see more information [here](https://docs.bacalhau.org/all-flags)
:::

### Further Examples

The following presents some examples that you can try.

#### Prompt
```
python main.py --p "cat with three eyes"
```

#### Number of iterations

```
python main.py --p "cat with three eyes" --n 100
```
#### Batch Size (No of images to generate)

```
python main.py --p "cat with three eyes" --b 2
```


## Setting up Docker Container

Now we have a working example, we can convert it into a format that allows us to perform inference in a distributed environment. First we will create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the inference code. 

```Dockerfile
FROM tensorflow/tensorflow:2.10.0-gpu

RUN apt-get -y update

RUN apt-get -y install --allow-change-held-packages libcudnn8=8.1.0.77-1+cuda11.2 git

RUN python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

RUN python -m pip install regex tqdm Pillow tensorflow tensorflow_addons ftfy  --upgrade --quiet

RUN pip install git+https://github.com/fchollet/stable-diffusion-tensorflow --upgrade --quiet

ADD main.py main.py

# Run once so it downloads and caches the pre-trained weights
RUN python main.py --n 1
```

The dockerfile leverages the latest official tensorflow GPU image and then installs other dependencies like `git`, `CUDA` packages and other image related necessities. See [the original repository](https://github.com/fchollet/stable-diffusion-tensorflow/blob/master/requirements.txt) for the expected requirements.

:::tip
Note the last line, which runs the script once to trigger the download of the pretrained weights. This is necessary for Bacalhau, because Bacalhau jobs do not allow access to the internet.
:::

### Build the container

We will run `docker build` command to build the container;

```
docker build -t <hub-user>/<repo-name>:<tag> .
```

Before running the command replace;

- **hub-user** with your docker hub username, If you don’t have a docker hub account [follow these instructions to create docker account](https://docs.docker.com/docker-id/), and use the username of the account you created

- **repo-name** with the name of the container, you can name it anything you want

- **tag** this is not required but you can use the latest tag

In our case

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --push -t ghcr.io/bacalhau-project/examples/stable-diffusion-gpu:0.0.1 .
```

Now you can push this repository to the registry designated by its name or tag.

```
docker push <hub-user>/<repo-name>:<tag>
```

## Running a Bacalhau Job to Generate an Image 

To run a Bacalhau job to generate an image Using Stable Diffusion on a GPU, we will use the `bacalhau docker run` command. 


```bash
%%bash --out job_id
bacalhau docker run --id-only --gpu 1 ghcr.io/bacalhau-project/examples/stable-diffusion-gpu:0.0.1 -- python main.py --o ./outputs --p "meme about tensorflow"
```

When a job is sumbitted, Bacalhau prints out the related `job_id`. We store that in an environment variable so that we can reuse it later on.


```python
%%env JOB_ID={job_id}
```

The `bacalhau docker run` command passes a prompt to the model and generates an image in the outputs directory. The main difference in the example below compared to all the other examples is the addition of the `--gpu X` flag, which tells Bacalhau to only schedule the job on nodes that have `X` GPUs free. You can [read more about GPU support](../../../next-steps/gpu) in the documentation. 

:::tip
This will take about 5 minutes to complete and is mainly due to the cold-start GPU setup time. This is faster than the CPU version, but you might still want to grab some fruit or plan your lunchtime run.

Furthermore, the container itself is about 10GB, so it might take a while to download on the node if it isn't cached.
:::

## Checking the State of your Jobs

- **Job status**: You can check the status of the job using `bacalhau list`. 


```bash
%%bash
bacalhau list --id-filter ${JOB_ID}
```

    [92;100m CREATED  [0m[92;100m ID       [0m[92;100m JOB                     [0m[92;100m STATE     [0m[92;100m VERIFIED [0m[92;100m PUBLISHED               [0m
    [97;40m 10:36:05 [0m[97;40m f126c9a5 [0m[97;40m Docker ghcr.io/bacal... [0m[97;40m Completed [0m[97;40m          [0m[97;40m /ipfs/QmatWywziRqxTh... [0m


When it says `Published` or `Completed`, that means the job is done, and we can get the results.

- **Job information**: You can find out more information about your job by using `bacalhau describe`.


```bash
%%bash
bacalhau describe ${JOB_ID}
```

If you see that the job has completed and there are no errors, then you can download the results with the following command:

- **Job download**: You can download your job results directly by using `bacalhau get`. Alternatively, you can choose to create a directory to store your results. In the command below, we created a directory and downloaded our job output to be stored in that directory.


```bash
%%bash
rm -rf results && mkdir -p results
bacalhau get $JOB_ID --output-dir results
```

    Fetching results of job 'f126c9a5-0fd6-41c5-88e2-2d66a64a1317'...

    2022/10/19 10:40:30 failed to sufficiently increase receive buffer size (was: 208 kiB, wanted: 2048 kiB, got: 416 kiB). See https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go/wiki/UDP-Receive-Buffer-Size for details.


After the download has finished you should see the following contents in results directory

## Viewing your Job Output

Each job creates 3 subfolders: the **combined_results**,**per_shard files**, and the **raw** directory. To view the file, run the following command:


```bash
%%bash
ls results/combined_results/outputs
```

### Display image


```python
import IPython.display as display
display.Image("results/combined_results/outputs/image0.png")
```
